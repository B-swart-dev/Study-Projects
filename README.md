### Project Specifications

1. Create an HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Use the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the beginning of the file.

   - Work experience (job titles, employers, dates, responsibilities)  
   - Skills (relevant skills or expertise)

   *(Hint: use the MDN docs for things you don't know how to do:  
   (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer))*
